A list is a sequence of values (similar to an array in other programming languages but more versatile)

The values in a list are called items or sometimes elements.

The important properties of Python lists are as follows:

* Lists are ordered – Lists remember the order of items inserted.
* Accessed by index – Items in a list can be accessed using an index.
* Lists can contain any sort of object – It can be numbers, strings, tuples and even other lists.
* Lists are changeable (mutable) – You can change a list in-place, add new items, and delete or update existing items.

# Python Lists

1. Lists is a collection of values/elements.
2. list is represented in [] brackets.
3. list allows both Homeogenous & Hetrogenous values/elements.
4. Lists are mutable.
5. list allow duplicate values/elements.
6. lists allow indexing and slicing.
7. Implication of iterations is Time-consuming.
8. The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
9. Lists consume more memory.
10. Lists have several built-in methods

6.  Multidimension Lists                                                          
7.  Concatenation Lists                                                           
8.  Operation Lists                                                               
9.  Iterable Lists
