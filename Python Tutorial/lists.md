A list is a sequence of values (similar to an array in other programming languages but more versatile)

The values in a list are called items or sometimes elements.

The important properties of Python lists are as follows:

* Lists are ordered – Lists remember the order of items inserted.
* Accessed by index – Items in a list can be accessed using an index.
* Lists can contain any sort of object – It can be numbers, strings, tuples and even other lists.
* Lists are changeable (mutable) – You can change a list in-place, add new items, and delete or update existing items.
