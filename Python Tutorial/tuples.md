# Tuples

source: `{{ page.path }}`

A tuple is an ordered collection of values.

Tuples are a lot like Tuples:

* Tuples are ordered – Tuples maintains a left-to-right positional ordering among the items they contain.
* Accessed by index – Items in a tuple can be accessed using an index.
* Tuples can contain any sort of object – It can be numbers, strings, Tuples and even other tuples.

except:

* Tuples are immutable – you can’t add, delete, or change items after the tuple is defined.

# Python Tuples

1. Tuples is a collection of values/elements.
2. Tuples is represented in () brackets.
3. Tuples allows both Homeogenous & Hetrogenous values/elements.
4. Tuples are immutable.
5. Tuples allow duplicate values/elements and insertion order.
6. Tuples allow indexing and slicing.
7. Implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
8. Tuples data type is appropriate for accessing the elements.
9. Tuples consume less memory as compared to the list.
10. Tuples does no have must built-in methods
